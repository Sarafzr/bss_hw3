        width="200"
        height="300"/>
        <p>This picture was taken on <time datetime="2022-05-14 19:00">Boardriders Friday</time</p>
        <p>For this assignment, the HTML element I decided to play with is the 'datetime' element.
            I learned that it is a useful way to format time and get a name for a calendar date. 
            You cannot tell that I used it but I used it for "Boardriders Friday" under the image.

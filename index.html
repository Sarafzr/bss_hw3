    <h1>Hello, my name is Sara!</h1>
    <p>I am currently a connective media student at Cornell Tech. My background is in biology.</p>
    <p>I enjoy surfing, rock climbing, and spending time with my dog</p>
    <img src="boardriders.JPG" width="200" height="300" />
    <P>This picture was taken on <time datetime="2022-05-14 19:00">Boardriders Friday</time></P>
    <p>For this assignment, the HTML element I decided to play with is the 'datetime' element.
        I learned that it is a useful way to format time and get a name for a calendar date.
        You cannot tell that I used it but I used it for "Boardriders Friday" under the image.
